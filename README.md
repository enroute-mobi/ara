## An innovative and modular solution

* Modular architecture organized in Collection, Model & Broadcast
* Multi-protocol connectors: SIRI, SIRI Lite (GTFS-RT soon)
* Real time Visualization / management of data by API
* Loading theoretical offer and / or network structure into a database
* Real time and parameterizable logging
* Managing multiple independent referentials in the same server
* Real time administration: exchange partners, referentials

## SIRI connectors

In collection and broadcast (both subscription and request)

* StopMonitoring
* EstimatedTimeTable
* Situational Management

In broadcast only:

* StopPointDiscovery
* LineDiscovery

## Versatile and multilingual

* Transcodification of data with use and correspondence between different types of identifiers on the same objects
* Management and configuration of identifier formats to adapt in real time the identifiers used with an exchange partner
* Modular import supply by a new product "Referentials"

## Real-time logging

Outsource, process and store in real time all exchanges managed by Ara :

* Send real time exchange data to BigQuery
